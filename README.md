# 0012_sentence_learner
This repository is explained here: https://noobtotyper.neocities.org/noobtotypes/0012_sentence_learner

The sentences need to be taken for only german language, from https://tatoeba.org/en/downloads

The frequency list is taken from https://github.com/hermitdave/FrequencyWords/blob/master/content/2018/de/de_full.txt

Execute first the sentence sorter with "python3 SentenceSorter.py > de_sentences_sorted.txt".

The main file is SentenceLearner.py, execute with "python3 SentenceLearner.py".

It works for the German language, it requires some tweaking for other languages.
